The C compiler \texttt{mycc} is built with \texttt{make}.

\texttt{src}, \texttt{lib}, and \texttt{include}.

\paragraph{\large\textbf{src}} is a source folder.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{mycc.c} is the main file of the project. Given arguments, the \texttt{main} function will choose a specific mode to process the input file and attache the corresponding result to the standard output or a output file (if specified).
    \item \textbf{util.c} contains utility functions for \texttt{mycc.c}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\large\textbf{lib}} defines library paths in addition to /usr/lib.

\paragraph{\large\textbf{include}} defines include directory.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{global.h} contains global variables and funtions.
